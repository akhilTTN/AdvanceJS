function test() {
console.log(a); //Line 1
console.log(fun()); //Line2

var a = 1;
function fun() {
return 2;
}
}

test();

Output

undefined
2

Reason for this Question:

this is a classic example of hosting.
here at line 1 a was not in the picture but was declared and defined in later lines.
stil we did not get any reference error due to the feature called hosting.
it takes all the defination in the code and puts it in the biggining.
so the above code becomes this

function test() {
var a;	//line 1
console.log(a); //Line 2
console.log(fun()); //Line3

   a = 1;
function fun() {
return 2;
}
}

test();

now 'var a' has been declared before the using but is not defined so we get undefined rather than reference error.
so line 2 prints undefined.
now line 3 logs the function fun. but at the time of logging the function fun was called which returned value 2 so the console.log prints 2 and hence the output

undefined
2
